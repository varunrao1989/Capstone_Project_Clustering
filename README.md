# Capstone_Project_Clustering
This project was part of coursera's "IBM Data Science Professional Certification".
The repo includes:
- Jupyter notebook 
- Pdf report

The Jupyter notebook includes links to datasets and a full rundown of all aspects considered in the project.
This project pulls data from "Foursquare" using APIs and clusters different neighborhoods of New York City, San Francisco and Toronto to find similar neighborhoods between the three cities. The notebook also discusses the value of this information and what are potential applications. 
* Since the .ipynb notebook does not show rendered coropleth maps, the code is raw NBConvert. The pdf file in the repo has all the renderings which can be visualized.
